# mlb-franchise-highlights
This is an R Shiny app that can be used to display each MLB franchise's top historical hitters by 4 different statistics: batting average, home runs, runs batted in and stolen bases. To use the app, simply select the franchise you are interested in from the drop down menu at the top. The graphs will update to display the top 10 players in each statistic from the selected team.

The app is hosted via Shinyapps here: <https://glakin.shinyapps.io/mlb_franchise_highlights_app/>

A deck describing how the app was built is available via RPubs here: <https://rpubs.com/glakin/mlb_batter_highlights_deck>

This app makes use of the Lahman Baseball Database: <http://http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/>
